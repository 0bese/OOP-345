Reflection on Workshop - Templates


This week's workshop centered on templates in C++, specifically implementing a templated `Collection` class and an `OrderedCollection` class. The `Collection` class template was defined to handle a fixed-size array of items of any data type, with a maximum capacity specified by the template parameter.


Key features implemented:
- Static Members: `m_smallestItem` and `m_largestItem` track the smallest and largest items.
- Operator Overloading: The `operator+=` method adds items to the collection, updates size, and adjusts the smallest and largest items.
- Array Subscript Operator: The `operator[]` provides access to elements by index.
- Initialization: Specialized static member initialization for the `Book` type.
- Print Method: Outputs the collection contents to a stream.


The `OrderedCollection` class extended `Collection` by maintaining items in a sorted order:
- Insertion with Ordering: The `operator+=` method was overridden to insert items while keeping the collection ordered.
- Inheritance: Leveraged methods from `Collection`, like `size`, `capacity`, and `print`.


Testing in `w3_p2.cpp` involved creating `Collection` and `OrderedCollection` objects for `int`, `double`, and `Book`, adding elements, printing collections, and verifying smallest and largest elements based on specific criteria.


The exercise demonstrated the flexibility of templates in creating generic data structures, enabling code reuse and type safety.
